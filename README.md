# FoxHunt

This program is intended to be used during an amateur radio "fox hunt."  The goal of a fox hunt is to locate a hidden radio
transmitter and be the first competitor to reach its location.  

The user must use a directional antenna to determine the compass bearing of the signal.
That bearing, along with the geographical location from which the reading was taken, are entered into the program.  The user then
moves perpendicular to the first reading and takes a second reading.  The second bearing and the geographical coordinate from which it
was taken are also entered into the program.  After two data sets have been entered the user may click the calculate button to receive
an estimated location of the transmitter.

As the user travels towards the transmitter, he may update his current position and receive updates on the distance and bearing to the transmitter.
